## DESCRIPTION:

Recommendation systems have become a cornerstone in modern digital experiences, helping users discover products, content, and services tailored to their preferences. From suggesting movies on Netflix to products on Amazon, these systems improve user engagement, satisfaction, and retention. In this internship project, we focus on building a **Recommendation System using Collaborative Filtering or Matrix Factorization** techniques.

Collaborative Filtering is a popular approach in recommendation systems that relies on the idea that users with similar preferences in the past will continue to share similar preferences in the future. Matrix Factorization, a model-based collaborative filtering technique, is used to uncover latent features underlying the interactions between users and items.

In this project, we implement a recommendation engine that analyzes user-item interaction data (such as ratings or purchase behavior) and predicts which items a user might like. We use models like **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)** or **Alternating Least Squares (ALS)** to perform matrix factorization, extract patterns, and generate personalized recommendations.



## ðŸ“‚ Dataset:

We utilize a dataset such as **MovieLens**, which contains thousands of user ratings for various movies. The dataset is ideal for collaborative filtering as it includes user IDs, item (movie) IDs, and rating scores.



## âœ… Implementation Steps:

1. **Import Required Libraries**: Including pandas, NumPy, surprise (or implicit), and matplotlib for analysis and visualization.
2. **Load and Explore Dataset**: Understand the structure, rating distribution, and sparsity of the user-item matrix.
3. **Preprocess the Data**: Handle missing values, convert data types, and prepare the matrix for modeling.
4. **Modeling with Collaborative Filtering**:
   - Implement User-Based or Item-Based Collaborative Filtering.
   - Or apply Matrix Factorization using SVD or ALS.
5. **Train the Model**: Fit the model on the training data.
6. **Make Predictions**: Predict unseen ratings or recommend top-N items to each user.
7. **Evaluate the Model**:
   - Use evaluation metrics such as RMSE, MAE, precision@k, and recall@k.
   - Visualize predicted vs actual ratings and recommendation rankings.
8. **Display Recommendations**: Show personalized item recommendations for selected users.


## ðŸŽ¯ Objective:

- Understand how collaborative filtering works and its real-world applications.
- Implement a recommendation system using matrix factorization.
- Learn to handle sparse data and improve model performance.
- Evaluate and visualize recommendation quality.


## ðŸ“Œ Conclusion:

Through this internship project, we gain practical exposure to building personalized recommendation systems. These systems are essential in domains like e-commerce, entertainment, and online education, where understanding user behavior is key.

We demonstrate how collaborative filtering can uncover hidden user-item relationships and improve decision-making. Whether it's suggesting a movie to watch or a book to buy, recommendation engines play a pivotal role in enhancing user experience.

By the end of this notebook, we successfully implement a recommendation pipeline capable of delivering accurate, personalized results â€” further strengthening our machine learning and data science skillset for real-world projects.
